        <b>The domestic dog</b> (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris
        when considered a distinct species) is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like
        canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.
        The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that
        were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first
        species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory
        capabilities, and physical attributes.
        Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to
        thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species. Dogs vary widely in shape, size
        and colors. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting
        police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles.
        This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend". The origin of the domestic
        dog includes the dog\'s evolutionary divergence from the wolf, its domestication, and its development into dog
        types and dog breeds. The dog is a member of the genus Canis, which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and was
        the first species and the only large carnivore to have been domesticated.
        The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, as modern wolves are not closely related to the population of
        wolves that was first domesticated. The genetic divergence between dogs and wolves occurred between
        40,000–20,000 years ago, just before or during the Last Glacial Maximum. This timespan represents the upper
        time-limit for the commencement of domestication because it is the time of divergence and not the time of
        domestication, which occurred later.
        The domestication of animals commenced over 15,000 years ago, beginning with the grey wolf (Canis lupus) by
        nomadic hunter-gatherers. The archaeological record and genetic analysis show the remains of the Bonn–Oberkassel
        dog buried beside humans 14,200 years ago to be the first undisputed dog, with disputed remains occurring 36,000
        years ago.
        It was not until 11,000 years ago that people living in the Near East entered into relationships with wild
        populations of aurochs, boar, sheep, and goats. Where the domestication of the dog took place remains debated,
        with the most plausible proposals spanning Western Europe, Central Asia and East Asia. This has been made more
        complicated by the recent proposal that an initial wolf population split into East and West Eurasian groups.
        These two groups, before going extinct, were domesticated independently into two distinct dog populations
        between 14,000 and 6,400 years ago. The Western Eurasian dog population was gradually and partially replaced by
        East Asian dogs introduced by humans at least 6,400 years ago. This proposal is also debated.
